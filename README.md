## How to set this up?

1. `git clone https://github.com/slds-lmu/lecture_dl4nlp.git`
2. `cd lecture_dl4nlp`
3. `git clone https://github.com/slds-lmu/latex-math.git`

## How to get started with your new lecture repository?

1. The very basic structure of the template contains
    1. `slides`: Raw `.tex` files of your lecture and the corresponding PDFs.
    1. `exercises`: Raw `.tex` exercise files  and the corresponding PDFs or `.ipynb` files.
    1. `code-demos`: Raw `.py` files for code demos (optionally, not yet there).
    1. `cheatsheets`: Material for cheatsheets optionally, not yet there).
    1. `latex-math`: Submodule included from `github.com/slds-lmu/latex-math` (see point 3 from setup).
    1. `style`: All relevant style files.
1. Each folder contains a `README.md` with more details.

## General editing workflow

1. The `main` branch should only contain the material that is visible on the [website](https://slds-lmu.github.io/dl4nlp/).
1. Work is exclusively done in subbranch of the `main` branch!
1. When you have finished a task, write a short understandable commit message, the smaller and more precise your commit is the better.
1. Create a PR to the `main` branch and describe what you have done, reference issues, etc. Also assign a reviewer if necessary.
1. The responsible person for the lecture then merges the PRs.
