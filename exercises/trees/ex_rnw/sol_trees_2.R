# we see they are pretty different.
# J48 is different from CART
# but we also see the "instability" of the tree learners themselves

# (side note: plotting both J48 and CART next to each other on one screen was harder than I expected ...
# one discovers great things in R everyday)

### complexity control



# helpers to fit with different param values and visualize
plotParamSequence = function(learner, task, param, values, plotfun, ...) {
  for (v in values) {
    xs = list(...)
    xs[[param]] = v
    lrn2= setHyperPars(learner, par.vals = xs)
    mod = train(lrn2, task)
    plotfun(mod$learner.model)

}

plotParamSequenceRPart = function(...)
  plotParamSequence(learner = lrn1, plotfun = rpart.plot, ...)

plotParamSequenceJ48 = function(...)
  plotParamSequence(learner = lrn2, plotfun = plot, ...)

### complexity control CART / rpart

minsplits = c(3, 10, 20)
plotParamSequenceRPart(task = task, param = "minsplit", values = minsplits)
cps = c(0.001, 0.02, 0.1)
plotParamSequenceRPart(task = task, param = "cp", values = cps, minsplit = 1)

# we could also call rpart::prune or do other stuff....

### complexity control for C4.5 / J48

# understand control params
Ms = c(5, 20)
plotParamSequenceJ48(task = task, param = "M", values = Ms)
Cs = c(0.25, 0.05)
plotParamSequenceJ48(task = task, param = "C", values = Cs)

# again we could look other params as well here

### model comparison:

# we already did that above with a 10x10 CV for models with defaults
# CART was a bit better in that case
# we will not do a proper model selection now here, tuning every single paramter...
