## Slides folder

Important files:
- `Makefile`: File mainly used by CI (GitHub Actions, GA) to render files for which the source has changed. You can try it locally by editing a `.tex` file of a subchapter and then call `make changes` in the `slides` directory.
- `tex.mk`: This makefile is used by the subchatpers to render all pdfs of a specific subchapter. Therefore change directory to `subchapter-xyz` and run `make`. The target `slides-pdf` is used by GA to render the files + copy them into `slides-pdf`.

Important workflows:
- Edit files:
  - Create a new branch `branch-xyz` from the `main` branch
  - Edit your files (see next workflows for editing rules)
  - Create a PR on the main branch. This triggers a GA build:
    - Render all `.tex` files in a subchapter that was edited
    - Copy to `slides-pdf`
    - Push into `branch-xyz`
  - To review the pdfs generated by GA pull your branch and verify that all pdfs are included in `slides-pdf`
- Create a new subchapter:
  - Create the folder `slides/my-subchapter`
  - Copy one of the makefiles `Makefile` from another subchapter (e.g. `ml-basics`)
  - __Note__ that all pdfs in the subchapter directory are ignored. PDFs in the figure folder of a subchapter on the other hand are valid.
- Locally render a subchapter:
  - Change directory into the subchapter
  - Run `make`
  - __Note__ that a latex distro must be installed (e.g. `texlive-full`, just `texlive` is not enough) and `latexmk`. For debian/ubuntu users call `sudo apt install -y texlive-full latexmk`
- Locally render one `.tex` file:
  - Simply use your favourite editor for that ...
