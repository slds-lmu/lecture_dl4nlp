  You poured yourself a glass of cranberry juice, but then
  you absentmindedly poured about a teaspoon of grape juice
  into it. It looks okay. You try sniffing it, but you have
  a bad cold, so you can’t smell anything. You are very
  thirsty. So 
  \item
  GPT continues: you drink it.

  You are now dead.

You are having a small dinner party. You want to serve
dinner in the living room. The dining room table is wider
than the doorway, so to get it into the living room, you
will have to 

  \item

remove the door. You have a table saw, so you
cut the door in half and remove the top half.

You are a defense lawyer and you have to go to court
today. Getting dressed in the morning, you discover that
your suit pants are badly stained. However, your bathing
suit is clean and very stylish. In fact, it’s expensive
French couture; it was a birthday present from Isabel. You
decide that you should wear

  GPT continues:
  the bathing suit to court. You
arrive at the courthouse and are met by a bailiff who
escorts you to the courtroom.

Janet and Penny went to the store to get presents for
Jack. Janet said, “I will buy Jack a top.” “Don’t get Jack a

At the party, I poured myself a glass of lemonade, but it
turned out to be too sour, so I added a little sugar. I
didn’t see a spoon handy, so I stirred it with a
cigarette. But that turned out to be a bad idea because

kept falling on the floor. That’s when he decided to start
the Cremation Association of North America, which has become
a major cremation provider with 145 locations.
